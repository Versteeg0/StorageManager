# WEBSJS
Javascript assignment me and my partner made for univeristy. The essence of the project was all about getting the feel of Javascript and 
puzzeling around with all its cool features and possibilities.

The most challenging part of the assignment was to figure out how the MVC structure was made in Javascipt. Ones we figured out how the structure worked the whole application was built within a couple of days.

We solved the MVC problem by going through all the source material given by the teachers and finding good examples how MVC structure is implemented in a javascript application.
